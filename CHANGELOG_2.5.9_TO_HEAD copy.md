### Completely Redesigned

Just about everything in this release is different. What hasn't changed is brand new. I basically rewrote the entire app to bring you:

* A much-requested **compact playlist layout**

* **Dark mode** support

* A sick new **player** with a **spectrum analyzer display** **`_̅̅̅̅̅_̅̅_̅_̅̅_̅̅̅̅̅_̅̅_̅̅̅_̅̅̅_̅̅̅̅̅_̅̅`**

* A new, immersive **playcut experience…**

  ### Playcut Info

  Each playcut in the playlist has a detailed info view.

* Add a playcut to your library on Spotify, Apple Music, etc.

* More info like artist bio, release year, and label.

* Links out to Discogs and Wikipedia.

### One-click Song Requests

- Listening to music in another app? Tap the share button to send a song request to the station.

### A Freakin Mac App

* Cause why not? My single goal in life is to get WXYC on as many screens as possible.

### To Top It All Off

* A hidden 🗿🥚 for you to find. In fact, first DJ to find it (screenshot or it didn't happen) gets a **free station t-shirt!**
