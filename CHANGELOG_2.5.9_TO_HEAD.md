# 🚨🚨 BRAND NEW iPHONE APP 🚨🚨

Strap yourselves in, folks, this is gonna be a big one I'm super excited to bring you the latest and greatest release of our iOS app. Just about everything in this release is different, and what hasn't changed is brand new. In fact, this is probably the single biggest upgrade in its 15-year history. 

* A much-requested **compact playlist layout**

* **Dark mode** support

* A sick new **player** with a **spectrum analyzer display** **`_̅̅̅̅̅_̅̅_̅_̅̅_̅̅̅̅̅_̅̅_̅̅̅_̅̅̅_̅̅̅̅̅_̅̅`**

* A new, immersive **playcut experience…**

  \#\## Playcut Info

  Each playcut in the playlist has a detailed info view.

* Add a playcut to your library on Spotify, Apple Music, etc.

* More info like artist bio, release year, and label.

* Links out to Discogs and Wikipedia.

### One-click Song Requests

- Listening to music in another app? Tap the share button to send a song request to the station.

### A Freakin Mac App

* Cause why not? My single goal in life is to get WXYC on as many screens as possible.

### To Top It All off

* I put an 🗿🥚 in there for you to find. In fact, we're running a contest. First DJ to find it (screenshots or it didn't happen) gets a **free station t-shirt!**
