### Completely Redesigned

Just about everything in this release is different. What hasn't changed is brand new. I rewrote the entire app to bring you:

* A much-requested **compact playlist layout**

* **Dark mode** support

* A sick new **player** with a **spectrum analyzer display** **`_̅̅̅̅̅_̅̅_̅_̅̅_̅̅̅̅̅_̅̅_̅̅̅_̅̅̅_̅̅̅̅̅_̅̅`**

* A new, immersive **playcut experience…**

  ### Playcut Info

  Each playcut in the playlist has a detailed info view.

* Add a playcut to your library on Spotify, Apple Music, etc.

* More info like artist bio, release year, and label.

* Links out to Discogs and Wikipedia.

### Plus

* **One-click song requests.** Listening to music in another app? Tap the share button to send a song request to the station.
* **A freakin Mac app!** Cause why not? My single goal in life is to put WXYC on as many screens as possible.
* **A refereshed iPad app that doesn't look like complete butt.**
* **A hidden 🗿🥚 for you to find.** In fact, the first DJ to find it gets a **free station t-shirt!** (Screenshots or it didn't happen.)
