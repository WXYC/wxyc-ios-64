# 64-bit iOS app

## History

So.... back in the heady days of 2010, [Jake B.](https://github.com/jakebromberg) made the very first open-source [WXYC iPhone app](https://github.com/jakebromberg/wxyc-iphone-app). At the time this was kind of a big deal as there weren't too many radio stations (let alone college stations) that had an app available for the iPhone. Fast-forward a couple years and that old app is still [choogling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUzl7_OpVLA) along (with a couple updates here and there over the years). 

**Head fake.**
iOS 11 is released and our plucky app is a 32-bit binary in a 64-bit world. Time to adopt a new offensive strategy.

No one at the station seemed interested in embarking on this journey, so out of work (out of luck?) former Station Manager [dvd](https://github.com/dvdokkum) made a list, checked it twice, prioritized, card-sorted, and SWATed all of the features a *new* and *improved* WXYC app would need. (OK actually not really, I was just trying to get it working for iOS 11 and didn't really give a shit about #features). 

This is the new repo. The new generation. Next gen. Gen X. Or. Like. Gen Z-ish. Whatever, it is modern as fuck.
